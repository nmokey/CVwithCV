The course that this site is adapted from, [UC Berkeley CS 198-126](https://ml-berkeley.notion.site/Modern-Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning-CS-198-126-0e28ffea0c4140f28399dd823c527bec){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, is an introductory Computer Vision course for college students. The goal of this site is to adapt a college-level course to be understandable to middle to hgih school students who are interested in taking a look at what computer vision and machine learning in general are like, so a lot of the explanations, math, and vocabulary are heavily simplified. Nonetheless, the content still requires some level of abstract thought and benefits from a basic understanding of knowledge that machine learning is based on, such as linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Still, I have done my best to explain the overarching concepts in a way that is accessible to everyone. If you don't understand the specifics, that's okay! 

The structure of the course is outlined [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/). It is divided into six clusters, which are generally grouped by topic and focus, and are also ordered roughly by complexity and currentness. Each lecture corresponds to a video lecture from the Berkeley course.
